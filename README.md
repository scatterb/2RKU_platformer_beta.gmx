# 2RKU - platformer (beta)

First attempt at making a somewhat advanced game with GameMaker

I might sometime return to this project. Or start from scratch with a new one.

--------------------

You're free to look through the code if you like and I've also included an exe-file so you'll be able play the game even without
GameMaker Studio. The game is playable on keyboard and a gamepad.
